# TorusBounces

This is a tool for simulating the trajectory of a particle inside of a deformed torus. The Processing applet allows for interactive exploration of the results for different initial conditions.

- The Julia code (torus.jl) depends on the Plots.jl package.
- The Processing applet depends on the G4P library for user interface widgets.
